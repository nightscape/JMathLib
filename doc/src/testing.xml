		JMathLib also has a testing engine which is used to support quality issues.
		A central goal of JMathLib is to test all functions automatically with
		a regression test framework. Currently we use 
		<ulink url="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</ulink> to improve code quality.

		There is also a mechanism to attach testing code to the standard user functions
		so that code and test-code can be kept in the same file. These tests are
		extracted from the general source, individual test case are going to be
		generated automatically.
