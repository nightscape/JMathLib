Running As Application

The  program can be run using the execute.sh script under GNU/Linux and the execute.bat script under Windows.

Just type:
run.bat


Running as an applet
=====================

Within the root of the classes folder there is an HTML file which will run
the JMathLib applet. So far it has been tested on IE 5.5, Netscape Navigator 6 & Opera 5
on Win ME & Konqueror & Mozilla firebird under GNU/Linux.
In due course JMathLib will be tested on other browsers and operating systems.

As long as this HTML file is in the same folder as the MathLib folder containing the
class files then it should run okay.
